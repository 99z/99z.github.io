## About


Recently completed a B.S. in computer science at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Starting off a freshman studying finance, I found I much preferred spending my time trying to understand Super Nintendo game programming than stock numbers.

After a year and a half of formal instruction in computer science I began working at Intel in California. While there I attended Viking Code School to up my programming abilities, and completed a couple of side projects.

During the summer of 2016 I worked remotely on [mySpiderweb](https://myspiderweb.com) with a team of two other developers and the founder. The small team led to a fantastic work experience and I'm proud to have had my hands in all aspects of the application.

I currently work at [HomeReport](http://homereport.io) as a full stack developer for a suite of cross-platform applications.

## Projects

### Indepedent study in code clone detection techniques
**Technologies uses**: Java  
View the white paper [here](/indstudy.pdf).

* Implemented a naive version of [GPLAG](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1150522).
* Compared GPLAG against widely-used tools for plagiarism detection in student code submissions.
* Benchmarked and analyzed tokenization vs. subgraph isomorphism detection techniques for code clone detection.

### [Kohaku](https://github.com/nicoNaN/kohaku)  
**Technologies used**: Ruby, Faraday

* Kohaku is an automated image tagging program written in Ruby using the Imagga API.
* Primarily targeted towards individuals who store a lot of pictures locally, such as imageboard users.

### [Recipe Book](https://github.com/nicoNaN/recipe-book)  
**Technologies used**: Ruby, Rails, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Angular.js

* Web application that allows users to scrape recipes from popular recipe websites and store them in a personal recipe book.
* Users may take notes on recipes, generate printable PDFs of recipes, follow other users, share recipes with other users, and view user activity in a feed.

### [Alice & August: A Love Story](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=56966)  
**Technologies used**: LÖVE framework, Lua, Photoshop

* Game created entirely from scratch in under 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 33 game jam.
* Made with no prior knowledge of Lua or the LÖVE framework.

From a user [review](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/09/13/my-top-three-part-2-deep-feels/):

> _Alice & August, by nic, is something like Dear Esther in its design. We are given a series of rooms to wander between, with each one bringing us a little closer to understanding our relationship to the absent other. Another very interesting choice is the lack of animation: the avatar is a still sprite, sliding through a maze. At times, however, we have to cross a long, featureless hallway and without animation to give us a sense of the passage of time we become anxious. Our anxiety — as to whether time is passing in a meaningful way at all, or whether the game has crashed — mirrors the protagonist’s anxiety after their own life spiraled out of control._
