Currently pursing a B.S. in computer science at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Starting off a freshman studying finance, I found I much preferred spending my time trying to understand Super Nintendo game programming than stock numbers.

After a year and a half of formal instruction in computer science I began working at Intel in California. While there I attended Viking Code School to up my programming abilities, and completed a couple side projects.

I’m currently working for mySpiderweb, a startup based out of Rochester, NY.

#### [August & Alice: A Love Story](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=56966)  
**Technologies used**: LÖVE framework, lua, photoshop

From a user [review](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/09/13/my-top-three-part-2-deep-feels/):

> Alice & August, by nic, is something like Dear Esther in its design. We are given a series of rooms to wander between, with each one bringing us a little closer to understanding our relationship to the absent other. Another very interesting choice is the lack of animation: the avatar is a still sprite, sliding through a maze. At times, however, we have to cross a long, featureless hallway and without animation to give us a sense of the passage of time we become anxious. Our anxiety — as to whether time is passing in a meaningful way at all, or whether the game has crashed — mirrors the protagonist’s anxiety after their own life spiraled out of control.

* Game created entirely from scratch in under 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 33 game jam.
* Made with no prior knowledge of Lua or the LÖVE framework.
