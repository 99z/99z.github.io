<p>Currently pursing a B.S. in computer science at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Starting off a freshman studying finance, I found I much preferred spending my time trying to understand Super Nintendo game programming than stock numbers.</p>

<p>After a year and a half of formal instruction in computer science I began working at Intel in California. While there I attended Viking Code School to up my programming abilities, and completed a couple side projects.</p>

<p>I’m currently working for mySpiderweb, a startup based out of Rochester, NY.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&amp;uid=56966">August &amp; Alice: A Love Story</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Technologies used</strong>: LÖVE framework, lua, photoshop</p>

<p>From a user <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/09/13/my-top-three-part-2-deep-feels/">review</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alice &amp; August, by nic, is something like Dear Esther in its design. We are given a series of rooms to wander between, with each one bringing us a little closer to understanding our relationship to the absent other. Another very interesting choice is the lack of animation: the avatar is a still sprite, sliding through a maze. At times, however, we have to cross a long, featureless hallway and without animation to give us a sense of the passage of time we become anxious. Our anxiety — as to whether time is passing in a meaningful way at all, or whether the game has crashed — mirrors the protagonist’s anxiety after their own life spiraled out of control.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Game created entirely from scratch in under 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 33 game jam.</li>
  <li>Made with no prior knowledge of Lua or the LÖVE framework.</li>
</ul>
