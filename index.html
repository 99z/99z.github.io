<h2 id="toc_1">About</h2>

<p>Starting off a freshman in college studying finance, I found I much preferred spending my time trying to understand Super Nintendo assembly programming rather than stock numbers.</p>

<p>After a year and a half of formal instruction in computer science I began working at Intel in California. While there I attended Viking Code School to further develop my programming abilities, and completed a couple of side projects.</p>

<p>During the summer of 2016 I worked remotely on <a href="https://myspiderweb.com">mySpiderweb</a> with a team of two other developers and the founder. The small team led to a fantastic work experience and I&#39;m proud to have had my hands in all aspects of the application.</p>

<p>I completed a B.S. in Computer Science from the Rochester Institute of Technology in May of 2017.</p>

<p>I currently work at <a href="http://homereport.io">HomeReport</a> as a full stack developer for a suite of cross-platform applications.</p>

<p>From a user <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/09/13/my-top-three-part-2-deep-feels/">review</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Alice &amp; August, by nic, is something like Dear Esther in its design. We are given a series of rooms to wander between, with each one bringing us a little closer to understanding our relationship to the absent other. Another very interesting choice is the lack of animation: the avatar is a still sprite, sliding through a maze. At times, however, we have to cross a long, featureless hallway and without animation to give us a sense of the passage of time we become anxious. Our anxiety — as to whether time is passing in a meaningful way at all, or whether the game has crashed — mirrors the protagonist’s anxiety after their own life spiraled out of control.</em></p>
