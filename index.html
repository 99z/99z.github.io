	<h2>About</h2>

	<p>When I was a freshman in college studying finance I found I much preferred spending my time trying to understand
		Super Nintendo assembly programming rather than stock numbers.</p>

	<p>After a year and a half of formal instruction in computer science I began working at Intel in California. While
		there I attended Viking Code School to further develop my programming abilities, and completed a couple of side
		projects.</p>

	<p>During the summer of 2016 I worked remotely on <a href="https://myspiderweb.com">mySpiderweb</a> with a team of
		two other developers and the founder. The small team led to a fantastic work experience and I&#39;m proud to
		have had my hands in all aspects of the application.</p>

	<p>I attended the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> from February to May of 2018 where I created a <a
			href="https://github.com/99z/halken">Game Boy emulator</a> in Go.</p>

	<p>I currently work at <a href="http://foyerapp.io">Foyer</a> as a programmer and technical director for a suite of
		cross-platform applications.</p>

		<p>From a user <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/09/13/my-top-three-part-2-deep-feels/">review</a>:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p><em>Alice &amp; August, by nic, is something like Dear Esther in its design. We are given a series of
					rooms to wander between, with each one bringing us a little closer to understanding our relationship
					to the absent other. Another very interesting choice is the lack of animation: the avatar is a still
					sprite, sliding through a maze. At times, however, we have to cross a long, featureless hallway and
					without animation to give us a sense of the passage of time we become anxious. Our anxiety — as to
					whether time is passing in a meaningful way at all, or whether the game has crashed — mirrors the
					protagonist’s anxiety after their own life spiraled out of control.</em></p>
